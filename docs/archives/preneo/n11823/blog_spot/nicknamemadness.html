						Hey! Welcome to the blog page. Where Luther can ramble about whatever the fuck she wants.
						<p>

						March 6th, 2023. "Nickname Madness"
						</h1>
						<p>
						I've had alot of nicknames over the years. So lets go over them, ok? ok.
						<p>
						Quick disclaimer that this is probably the most open ill get about anything. if more i'm kind of just throwing myself under the bus.
						<p>
						Any names will also be anonymous for the sake of not throwing them under the bus too.
						<p>
						Okay, So it's 2016. And your older sister makes a persona about like a DJ. Like the little copycat i was, I joined in. We had our initials in the name. So for the sake of this, These initials will be KJ And PG. (KJ being me, and PG being my sister.)
						<p>
						My sister had hers as DJPG, And i joined in with DJKJ. This name stuck with me for awhile.
						<p>
						Big skip coming, Since i never used any real usernames but for my real name.
						<p>
						Late 2020, Early 2021? Something like that. That was when "External" came along. I snatched it from my sister, and it just stuck with me for a long time. I made alot of cool friends, Some left, Some stayed with me.
						<p>
						It's now around Probably early 2022, I made alot more usernames, The ones i can remember are Chaoluris, CHA03_REMA1NS, Luther, ONICORN_MANIA, Nova And Kai. So lets also get into those!!!!
						<p>
						Luther is first, Since thats what i use the most. Luther was kind of supposed to  be a different name, But it ended up this way. I was into geometry dash when creating luther. I had played a level with the name "clutterfunk" in it (not that level tho) and i died in the middle of clutterfunk being shown. And i saw "lutter". You can kind of see the name i wanted to go for. Lutter is its own character too, but thats basically just a genderbend of luther.
						<p>
						Ok, now We'll get into Chaoluris. I'm not fully sure how i got this name, but i'm pretty sure my sister gave me a list of names, and i picked one, which was chaoluris. I don't use the name that often, but it may bring a comeback...
						<p>
						CHA03_REMA1NS doesn't have much of a backstory. I was bored, it was late, and i wanted to grab a quick name to use. I wanted something to do with "CHAOS" and something to do with "REMAINS", And with numbers. So i just... Mashed the two together and got CHA03_REMA1NS.
						<p>
						ONICORN_MANIA is a weird one. I was playing a minecraft server with my sister, and i mixed two words together, Now im not fully sure what those two words were <i> exactly, </i> But its fun to look back on.
						<p>
						Nova was one when i was hating my name. I didn't like it. I already had a new name for myself, But i slowly started not liking that one.
						<p>
						Now kai. I don't <b> "mind" </b> kai, but i still dont like it as much. Its still nice though.
						<p>
						God, Sorry for the long one on 2022. But now its 2023. Probably is right now as you're reading this!
						<p>
						Now we have hkrk40k. Its still pretty early in 2023, so i dont have any figured out.
						<p>
						My sister had made a channel for a small group including us. And my name in that was hkrk40k. So naturally i just went with having that.

						Its the end now, You can leave!!! Thanks for listening.
